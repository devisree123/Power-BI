üåç Air Quality Control in India (2015-2020) - Power BI Report
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive report on the Air Quality Control in India from the years 2015 to 2020. The report is developed using Power BI, and it offers a deep dive into various critical insights derived from the data on air pollution across India during this period.

Report Highlights
1. Top 3 Most Polluted Cities
Identifies the cities with the most significant air quality challenges.
Aids in prioritizing efforts to address pollution in these hotspots.
2. Top 3 Least Polluted Cities
Highlights the regions with the cleanest air.
Serves as benchmarks for other cities aiming to improve their air quality standards.
3. AQI Trend Overview
Tracks the Air Quality Index (AQI) trends over the six years.
Provides insights into the fluctuations in air pollution and contributing factors.
4. Area-wise AQI Overview
Offers a detailed analysis of air quality across different regions of India.
Essential for localized policy-making and targeted interventions.
5. Average Levels of Major Pollutants (CO, SO‚ÇÇ, NO, PM2.5)
Displays average levels of critical pollutants via detailed cards.
Crucial for understanding the broader impact on public health and the environment.
Data Transformation & Analysis
The project also includes the process of data cleaning and transformation using advanced Power Query functions. Key techniques employed include:

Merging columns
Removing null rows
Converting the first row into headers
Efficient data loading
These steps ensured that the data used in the report is accurate, clean, and ready for insightful analysis.
